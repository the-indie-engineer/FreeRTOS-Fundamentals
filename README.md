<h2> Introduction to FreeRTOS </h2>

FreeRTOS is a popular open-source real-time operating system designed for embedded systems. It provides a rich set of features, such as task scheduling, inter-task communication, synchronization, and memory management. FreeRTOS is designed to be portable, scalable, and easy to use.

<h2>Semaphores</h2>

A semaphore is a synchronization object that is used to protect shared resources from being accessed simultaneously by multiple tasks. This repository covers the basics of semaphore usage in FreeRTOS, including creating, deleting, and using semaphores to protect shared resources.

<h2>Queues</h2>

A queue is a data structure that is used to store and pass messages between tasks in a FreeRTOS application. This repository covers the basics of queue usage in FreeRTOS, including creating, deleting, and using queues to pass messages between tasks.

<h2>Mutexes</h2>

A mutex is a synchronization object that is used to protect shared resources from being accessed simultaneously by multiple tasks. This repository covers the basics of mutex usage in FreeRTOS, including creating, deleting, and using mutexes to protect shared resources.

<h2>Tasks</h2>

A task is a unit of work that can be executed independently by the FreeRTOS scheduler. This repository covers the basics of task creation, deletion, and synchronization in FreeRTOS.

<h2>Installation</h2>

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have FreeRTOS installed on your system. FreeRTOS is available for a wide range of microcontrollers and development boards, and can be downloaded from the FreeRTOS website.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
